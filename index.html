        <p>My hobby is to do coding whenever I like to do it or when I get a project.After lunch or in the morning I like to do coding it is very interesting to do.I like it because whenever I make an app I learn new things.My Maam also helps me in doing coding she is the best coding teacher that is why I like to do coding.It is a good source of enjoyment and knowledge.By coding we can built our own apps which we can them publish also.It also makes our creativity nice.</p>
